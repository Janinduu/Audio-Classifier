# Deep-Audio-Classifier


## Overview

The Bird Call Detection project aims to develop a deep learning-based system for identifying bird species within audio recordings. Leveraging techniques from signal processing and machine learning, this project addresses the challenge of automating the detection and classification of bird calls, contributing to research in ornithology and environmental monitoring.

## Project Procedure

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

- **Audio Dataset**: Gather a diverse collection of audio recordings containing bird calls and ambient background noise. Ensure the dataset covers a variety of bird species and environmental conditions.
- **Spectrogram Generation**: Preprocess the audio data by converting raw waveforms into spectrograms using techniques like Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Spectrograms provide a visual representation of the frequency content over time, making them suitable for deep learning models.

### 2. Data Labeling and Annotation

- **Labeling**: Assign labels to the spectrograms indicating the presence or absence of bird calls. Use binary classification, where positive labels indicate the presence of bird calls and negative labels represent background noise.
- **Annotation Tools**: Employ annotation tools or manual labeling processes to annotate the spectrogram dataset accurately. Ensure consistency and quality in labeling to facilitate effective model training.

### 3. Model Development and Training

- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Design a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture tailored for spectrogram classification tasks. Experiment with different network architectures, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- **Model Training**: Train the CNN model using the labeled spectrogram dataset. Implement training procedures such as batch processing, optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, SGD), and learning rate scheduling to optimize model performance.
- **Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Validate the model's performance using a separate validation dataset. Fine-tune hyperparameters, including network architecture, learning rates, and regularization techniques, to improve model accuracy and generalization.

### 4. Evaluation and Performance Metrics

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate the trained model using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Analyze the model's ability to correctly classify bird calls while minimizing false positives and false negatives.
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Generate a confusion matrix to visualize the model's classification results across different bird species and background noise categories. Identify areas of improvement and potential sources of misclassification.

### 5. Model Deployment and Application

- **Deployment Pipeline**: Develop a deployment pipeline to deploy the trained model for real-world applications. Consider integrating the model into existing software platforms, web applications, or edge devices for on-device inference.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Ensure scalability and efficiency in model deployment, considering factors such as inference speed, memory footprint, and computational resources.
- **Continuous Monitoring and Maintenance**: Establish mechanisms for monitoring model performance and detecting drift or degradation over time. Implement regular model updates and retraining cycles to adapt to evolving data distributions and environmental conditions.
